## Casino Transaction Management System

### Overview

You are tasked with building a simple transaction management system for a casino. The system will track user transactions related to their bets and wins. The transactions will be processed asynchronously via a message system, and the data will be stored in a relational database. You will also need to expose an API to allow querying of transaction data.

### Key Components

#### 1. Message System

* Choose either **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** as the message system.
* The system will receive transaction data (bet/win events) as messages, which need to be processed and saved in the database.

#### 2. Database

* Choose either **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** as the database to store the transaction data.
* Each transaction will include the following fields:
  * `user_id` (The ID of the user making the transaction)
  * `transaction_type` (Either `"bet"` or `"win"`)
  * `amount` (The amount of money for the transaction)
  * `timestamp` (The time the transaction occurred)

#### 3. Transaction API

* The client needs to query transaction data, either for a single user or for all transactions.
* It should also support filtering by transaction type (e.g., `bet`, `win`, or all transactions).

### Requirements

#### 1. Message Consumer

* Create a message consumer that listens for messages (bet/win transactions) from the chosen message system (Kafka or RabbitMQ).
* The consumer must process the messages asynchronously and store the transaction details in the chosen database.

#### 2. Database

* Set up the database schema to store the transaction data.

#### 3. API

* Implement the API in **Go**.
* The API must allow users to query their transaction history, with support for filtering by `transaction_type` (e.g., `bet`, `win`, or all).
* Ensure the API returns the transactions in **JSON** format.

#### 4. Testing

* Write unit and integration tests for all components.
* Test coverage should be at least **85%**.

#### 5. Documentation

* Provide a `README` file with any relevant instructions.

### Submission

* Please submit the source code (how you prefer) along with the `README` file.
